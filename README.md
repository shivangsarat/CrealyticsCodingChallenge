# Getting Started with CrealyticsCodingChallenge App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



## __Instructions__

### Versions

Node: `v16.13.0`
npm: `8.1.0`

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm i`

Installs all the required dependencies from package.json.

This command will create node_module/ directory and package-lock.json file.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
For testing Jest and Puppeteer Frameworks are used

__Instructions for running Test__

For running the test you need to run this app in another terminal or in background
#### `By running app in another Console/Terminal` :
- In first Terminal run start script
```
npm start
```
- Once the app has started, switch terminal to run the test script
```
npm test
```
It'll then Iterate over all the test cases and dispaly results

#### `By running app in Background` :
To run the app in background we could use pm2
- We will install PM2 Gobally
```
npm install pm2@latest -g
```
- Now from command prompt navigate inside the projectâ€™s root folder and run below mentioned PM2 command.
```
pm2 start --name CrealyticsCodingChallenge npm -- start
```
- Once the app has started, switch terminal to run the test script
```
npm test
```
It'll then Iterate over all the test cases and dispaly results
- To stop the service use command
```
pm2 stop CrealyticsCodingChallenge
```
- To delete the service use command
```
pm2 delete CrealyticsCodingChallenge
```

### Additional Libraries Used

#### sass

For Stylesheet to import scss files, [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) library is installed

```
npm i sass -s
```

#### Material UI/MUI

[MUI](https://mui.com/) is a React UI framework. MUI components work in isolation. They are self-supporting, and will only inject the styles they need to display.

This is used to create an interactive and presenatble UI for this project.

```
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled -s
npm install @mui/icons-material -s
```

#### Material UI/MUI

[Puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.

This Library is used for creating UI render specific Test Cases.
```
npm i puppeteer -s
```

**Note: All of the above mentioned libraries are saved in [package.json](https://github.com/shivangsarat/CrealyticsCodingChallenge/blob/main/package.json). It'll be installed with command `npm i`!**

### Test Cases Covered:
- Checking basic rendering of elements:
    - Contains the Search Box
    - Pagination limit of 100
    - Contains the Product name
    - Contains the Product price
    - Contains the Product sale_price
    - Contains the Product gtin
    - Contains the Product gender
    - Contains the Product Image
    - Expands on click displaying another image
    - On click of Load More button add another 100 items in the list maintaining the Pagination limit of 100
- Product List Checking Functionality
    - Checks product rendered on first keypress element
    - Checks product rendered on second keypress element and product different from previous entry
    - Checks for product rendered on price switch that sale price is less than product price
    - Checks the product for gender matching to applied filter

### WorkFlow
- #### Fetching CSV File

    - Fetching of CSV file is done in [src/ProductList/index.js line 27-40](https://github.com/shivangsarat/CrealyticsCodingChallenge/blob/main/src/ProductList/index.js#L27-L40) in useEffect with empty array as dependency immitating componentDidMount.
    - To fetch from CSV we use ```fetch("./products.csv")``` function to get the result and convert it to text using ```.text()`` function.
    - Once the data is fetched, it is paseed to [Plugins/JsonFromCSV.js](https://github.com/shivangsarat/CrealyticsCodingChallenge/blob/main/src/Plugins/JsonFromCSV.js) where the data is seperated in form of array and mapped together to form an array of objects.
    ***Note: in JsonFromCSV between [Line 14 - Line 16](https://github.com/shivangsarat/CrealyticsCodingChallenge/blob/main/src/Plugins/JsonFromCSV.js#L14-L16) it is checked if in parsing data gender is shifted to a index below and handled.***
    ***Note: in JsonFromCSV between [Line 17 - Line 19](https://github.com/shivangsarat/CrealyticsCodingChallenge/blob/main/src/Plugins/JsonFromCSV.js#L17-L19) it is checked if gender is in the scope ("male", "female", "unisex"). If not, then data is not entered into final product listing.***
    - After recieving the data in desired format (JSON), data is added to state in items list and loading message is turned off.

- #### Rendering Products
    - Products are rendered using a component [src/ProductList/ProductCard.js](https://github.com/shivangsarat/CrealyticsCodingChallenge/blob/main/src/ProductList/ProductCard.js) in [Line 135 0f src/ProductList/index.js](https://github.com/shivangsarat/CrealyticsCodingChallenge/blob/main/src/ProductList/index.js#L135)
